The following steps will run the project in the *development* mode:

1. Clone the project: `$ git clone https://the-project`

2. Go to the project directory: `$ cd the-project`

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

4. Start the server: `npm run dev`

The page will reload if you make edits, 
and any lint errors will appear in the console.
